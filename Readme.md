# UniD – Universal Decentralized Identity

UniD is a decentralized identity management platform that enables users to create, manage, and verify self-sovereign digital identities (DIDs) on the blockchain. It offers a secure, transparent, and user-controlled alternative to centralized identity systems.

## Overview

Individuals today lack control over their digital identity — data is scattered across platforms and gatekept by centralized services. UniD tackles this problem by providing a blockchain-based solution built for interoperability, privacy, and portability. Users can assert identity, manage credentials, and engage with Web3 and Web2 services under their control.

## Key Features

- **Create Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs):** Generate W3C-compliant DIDs on an EVM blockchain.
- **On-chain Identity Registry:** A smart contract-based registry ensures immutable identity records.
- **User-Controlled Credentials:** Issue, store, and share verifiable credentials without centralized authorities.
- **Web3 Integrations:** Wallet-based authentication with Ethereum-compatible chains.
- **Privacy Controls:** Users decide what data to expose, with future roadmap support for ZK proofs.
- **Extensible Architecture:** Modular design optimized for integration into other applications.

## Installation & Setup

Clone and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aerostorm19/UniD.git
cd UniD
npm install
```
## Use Cases

- **Decentralized KYC:** Enable identity verification for DeFi platforms without exposing sensitive personal data.
- **Academic Credentials:** Issue and verify blockchain-based diplomas, degrees, and certifications.
- **Professional Identity:** Maintain an on-chain portfolio and reputation for freelancers, consultants, and contributors.
- **Web3 Login:** Authenticate users in decentralized applications (dApps) using decentralized identifiers (DIDs).
- **Health Data Privacy:** Share health-related credentials selectively, preserving privacy and ownership.
